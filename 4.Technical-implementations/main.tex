\textit{As the first part of this thesis' work development, hardware adaptations were implemented and software protocols were programmed for the and stimulus presentation to be used in the experiments. This was done with the open-source arduino-based system Bpod, by adapting the previously used microkernel-based system Bcontrol. This required the development of a synchronized graphical user interface, the communication between a governing machine, a microscopy apparatus, a stimuli monitor and a bpod device, within minimal processing time, as well as different states matrices and protocols for each type of visual stimulation display - RF mapping, tuning mapping and SM properties investigation. %there is no behavior, animal is anaesthetised
Moreover, the system also required proper functionality within the software controlling the two-photon microscope, which was enabled by the trigger and configuration settings of the software ScanImage.}
