\textit{As the first part of this thesis' work development, hardware adaptations were implemented and software protocols were programmed for the real-time behavioural control and stimulus presentation to be used in the experiments. This was done with the open-source arduino-based system Bpod, by adapting the previously used microkernel-based system Bcontrol. This required the development of a synchronized graphical user interface, the communication between a governing machine, a microscopy apparatus, a stimuli monitor and a bpod device, within minimal processing time, as well as different states matrices and protocols for each type of visual stimulation display - RF mapping, tuning mapping and SM properties investigation.
Moreover, the system also required proper functionality within the software controlling the two-photon microscope, which was enabled by the trigger and configuration settings of the software ScanImage.}
